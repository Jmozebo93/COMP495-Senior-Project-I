# For chat:
Current Idea:
    - If current user is a student they chat with advisors only and if current user is a advisor the can only 
     chat with a student:
        -Current user should select a user to chat with:
        - If the selected user is not online:
            -Old messages should load into chat window for the current user
            -When current user sends a message it should go to the database
        -If selected user is online:
            -They should be able to send messages in real time with the websockets
            -Old messages should load into chat window for both users if there are any
            -The sent messages should be sent to the database

#View Advisees Page:
    - The current user should be an advisor and an advisor only in order to access this page
    - The current user should be able to search for profile of student by name. As
        the current user searches, suggested users should show up and then the current user should be able 
        to select the user and open up their profile

#Student Profile Page:
    -The current user should be a student and only a student
    The current user should go to their profile page and see their student information that is in the database,
     displayed on the page.
